# Getting Started with Rewired

Rewired is a digital logic and circuit simulator for building logic gates, registers, memory, CPUs and other digital hardware.

## 1. Download

Use the latest GitHub Release:

https://github.com/patyczak232323/Rewired/releases/latest

Available packages:

- `DLSRewired-Windows-x64.zip`
- `DLSRewired-Linux-x86_64.zip`
- `DLSRewired-WebGL.zip` (runs in a browser)
- `DLSRewired-Android-arm64.apk` (experimental)

Extract the archive before running it. On Android, open the APK and allow installing apps from that source if asked. On a phone the app turns with the screen; *SETTINGS → SCREEN* in the main menu can keep it sideways or upright. Upright, the parts panel moves below the board and the top bar gets a second row.

### Browser (WebGL)

Unzip `DLSRewired-WebGL.zip` and serve the folder that contains `index.html` from any static web host. To try it locally, run this inside that folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`. Opening `index.html` straight from disk usually fails, because browsers block loading the game files from `file://`. Projects are kept in the browser's own storage; the native JIT and FULL LUT accelerators are not available there, so large circuits run slower.

### Linux

If needed:

```bash
chmod +x DLSRewired
./DLSRewired
```

## 2. Start with a small circuit

A good first progression is:

1. NAND / AND logic
2. Half Adder
3. Full Adder
4. Multiplexer
5. D Flip-Flop
6. 4-bit Register
7. RAM4x4
8. CPU4

Ready-to-read RHDL versions are available in `Examples/RHDL/`.

## 3. Use the graphical editor

Rewired retains the familiar visual circuit-building workflow inherited from Digital Logic Sim. Components can be connected into reusable Custom Chips and nested into larger systems.

For stateful designs, test clocks, feedback and reset behaviour carefully.

## 4. Try RHDL Studio

RHDL is Rewired's hardware description language.

Minimal example:

```text
chip And2
    in A, B
    out Y

    Y = A and B
```

Name the chip, list its `in` and `out` pins, and give each output a value. Build the source in RHDL Studio to generate an ordinary Rewired chip.

For syntax, buses, loops, components and feedback, read [RHDL_GUIDE.md](RHDL_GUIDE.md).

## Global custom chips

The save dialog has an `AVAILABILITY` selector:

- `THIS PROJECT` stores the custom chip only in the open project.
- `ALL PROJECTS` stores one shared copy and makes it available in every project.

A global chip may use built-in chips and other global chips. Make custom dependencies global first. Rewired blocks conflicting global names and blocks moving a shared chip back to one project while another project still depends on it.

## 5. Try the RAM example

`Examples/RHDL/Memory/00_RAM4x4.rhdl` implements four 4-bit words using normal registers.

It demonstrates:

- address decoding
- synchronous writes
- combinational reads
- reusable stateful components

## 6. Try CPU4

`Examples/RHDL/CPU4/00_CPU4.rhdl` is the largest processor example in the repository.

It has:

- 4-bit accumulator
- 4-bit PC
- 16 program addresses
- arithmetic and logic instructions
- conditional and unconditional jumps
- output register
- halt state

See `Examples/RHDL/CPU4/README.md` for the ISA and a test ROM program.

For a bigger processor, open the **CPU8** project that comes with Rewired: an 8-bit single-cycle CPU with 32 instructions, eight registers and 256 bytes of RAM, built the way you would build it by hand, from NOT, AND, OR and XOR chips up to the ALU and the control unit. `Examples/RHDL/CPU8/README.md` describes it. The **Core8** project is a processor core alone, built from NAND gates up with a 3-state bus and no memory inside, ready for you to connect your own ROM and RAM; see `Examples/RHDL/CORE8/README.md`.

## 7. Debug larger circuits

For difficult circuits, use the simulation diagnostics and profiling tools described in [SIMULATION_DIAGNOSTICS.md](SIMULATION_DIAGNOSTICS.md).

- **Truth table**: right-click a custom chip (on Android, tap it) and pick *TRUTH TABLE* to see every input combination. *RECORD TEST* saves the table; the test re-runs whenever the window opens, so a later change that breaks the chip shows up in red.
- **Breakpoints**: right-click a pin (on Android, tap it) and pick *BREAKPOINT* to pause the simulation when it changes, rises, falls or reaches a value. *SPACE* (or *STEP* on Android) then advances one tick at a time.
- **Export**: *EXPORT* in a chip's menu or the bottom-bar menu (*MENU* on Android) writes structural Verilog (also copied to the clipboard), an SVG schematic or a PNG screenshot to the project's `Exports` folder. On Android 10 and later each export is also copied to `Download/Rewired`, and *SHARE LAST EXPORT* sends it to another app.

## Desktop editing shortcuts

- **Ctrl+A** selects every part of the chip you are editing.
- **Ctrl+C** copies the selected parts and the wires between them; **Ctrl+X** also deletes them. **Ctrl+V** pastes them at the mouse; click to put them down. A copy can be pasted into another chip or project. Chips the target cannot use (missing from the project, or ones that contain the chip being edited) are left out.
- **Ctrl+Z** undoes; **Ctrl+Shift+Z** or **Ctrl+Y** redoes. **Shift+D** duplicates the selection.
- All of these can be changed in *Settings* on the home screen.

## Android controls

The screen has three parts: the top bar, the *PARTS* panel on the left and the board.

- **Add parts**: drag a part from *PARTS* onto the board, or tap it and then tap the board. The panel's left column picks a category; *MY CHIPS* lists the chips you have saved, and *FIND* searches every chip by name.
- **Wire**: drag from one pin to another, or tap a pin and then another pin. A touch just next to a pin counts as a touch on it, so pins do not have to be hit exactly. Tapping empty space on the way adds a bend; the banner at the top has *UNDO BEND* and *CANCEL*.
- **Try it**: tap the round button of an input to switch it on and off.
- **Change**: tap a part to select it. Its actions (*LOOK INSIDE*, *TRUTH TABLE*, *LABEL*, *FLIP*, *COPY*, *DELETE*, *MORE*) appear at the bottom of the board. Drag a part to move it.
- **Move around**: drag empty space to move the view, pinch to zoom. The buttons on the right fit the whole chip on screen, switch on area selection (drag a box round several parts), and zoom in and out.
- **Top bar**: *MENU* (new chip, chip library, truth table, export, RHDL Studio, settings, the guide, main menu), *PARTS* to show or hide the panel, undo and redo, *RUN*/*PAUSE*, *STEP* and *SAVE*.
- Holding a finger on a part, pin or wire opens its full menu. Android's Back button closes whatever is open, one step at a time.

## Compatibility note

Rewired is based on Digital Logic Sim but uses a different simulation model. Existing projects may load successfully while timing-sensitive or race-dependent behaviour can differ.
